## Dependencies

You need to have the following dependencies installed.

i3

- Polybar: Status bar
- Source code pro font

Kitty terminal

- Source code pro font

Neovim

- Packer package manager

## Installation

- Copy all the files from the `.config` file to your config file
- Set nvim config file to the one in your `.config` by running the command `nvim -c ~/.config/nvim`
- Open Neovim and run command `:PackerSync` - Installs all the plugins
- Install tree-sitter syntax highlight stuff for different programming languages by running the command `:TSInstall <language>`

That's should be it. If you notice a one step missing or you have errors you can open a issue on github.

... I probably forgot to add some instructions.
